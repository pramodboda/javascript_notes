# Introduction
## What is JavaScript?
- JavaScript is the Programming language of the **Web**
- JavaScript is part of the triad of technologies that all developers must learn

Language  |  Role  |  Description
------  |  ---------  | ----------
HTML  | Content  |  to specify the content of the web pages.
CSS  |  Presentation  |  to specify the presentation of the web pages.
JS  |  Behavior  |  to specify the behavior of the web pages.

- JavaScript is a high-level programming language.
- JavaScript is a case-sensitive language.
	- This means that language keywords, variables, function names, and other identifiers must always be typed with a consistent capitalization of letters.

```javascript
var name = "Pramod Boda"; //initiated variable 'name'
Name; // will not be same as 'name'
NAME; // will not be same as 'name'
name; => "Pramod Boda"
```

- All web browsers support it without the need for plug-ind by means of a built-in JavaScript engine.
- JavaScript is used on desktops, games consoles, tablets, and smart phones.
- Including JavaScript interpreters, making JavaScript the most ubiquitous programming language in history.
- JavaScript well-suited to object-oriented and functional programming style.
- The overwhelming majority of modern websites use JavaScript, and all web browsers.
- JavaScript has long since out grown its scripting - language roots to become a robust and efficient general - purpose language.

## Lexical Structure

- The lexical structure of a programming language is the set of elementary rules that specifies how you write programs in that language.

### Character Set
- JavaScript programs are writing using the Unicode character set.
- unicode is a superset of ASCII and Latin-1 and supports virtually every written language currently used on the planet.

### Case sensitivity
- JavaScript is a case-sensitive language. This means that language keywords, variables, funations names, and other identifies must always be typed with consistent capitalization of letters.
```javascript
var name = "Pramod Boda"; //initiated variable 'name'
Name; // will not be same as 'name'
NAME; // will not be same as 'name'
name; => "Pramod Boda"
```

> Note: however, thet HTML is not case-sensitive(althought XHTML is).

- Many client-side JavaScript objects and properties have the same names as the HTML tags and attributes they represent. 
- While these tags and attributes names can be typed in any case in HTML, In JavaScript they typically must be all lowercase.

> The HTML onclick event handler attribute is sometimes specified as onClick in HTML, but it must be specified as onclick in JavaScript code( or in XHTML documents).

### Comments
- JavaScript supports two style of comments.
- Any text between a // and the end of a line is treated as a comment. and is ignored by JavaScript.
- Single comment example:
```javascript
// This is a Single line comment.
```

- Any text between the characters /* and */ is also treated as a comment; These comments may span mutiple lines but may not be nested.
- Multi-Line comment example:
```javascript
/* 
* This is a
* Multiple lines
* comment.
*/
```

### Literals 

- A literals is a data that appears directly in a program.
```javascript
46 // The Number forty six.
4.6 // The Number four point six.
"Hylo World" // A String of text.
'Hi' // Another String.
true // A Boolean value.
false // another Booleans value.
/javascript/gi // A regular expression literal (for pattern matching)
null // Absence of object.
```

```javascript
x:3, y:5 // An object initializer
[1,2,3,a,b,c,4,5] // An array initializer.
```

### Identifiers
- An identifires is simple a name. In JavaScript, identifires are used to name variables and functions and to provide labels for certain loops in JavaScript code.
- These are all legal identifiers: 
```javascript
var trueVar
my_variable_name()
var v143
_trueVariable()
var $strVariable
```

#### mathematical symbols
```javascript
var si = true;
var Ï€ = 3.14;
```

### Reserved Words


### Dynamic Typing
JavaScript is a loosely typed or a dynamic language.

## Data types
The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:
- Six data types that are primitives:
  - Number
  - String
  - Boolean
  - Undefined
  - Null
  - Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015) 
- and Object

```javascript
typeof 143
=> "number"
```
```javascript
typeof "Pramod"
=> "string"
```
```javascript
typeof true
=> "boolean"
```
```javascript
typeof undefined
=> "undefined"
```
```javascript
typeof null
=> "object"
```
```javascript
typeof []
=> "object"
```
```javascript
typeof {}
=> "object"
```
```javascript
typeof NaN
=> "number"
```
### Numbers
### Strings
### Boolean
### Undefined
### Null

### Best ways to check for each type
```javascript
var foo;

typeof foo == 'undefined'
=>true

isNaN(foo);
=>true

foo === undefined
=>true
```





### What happens when you divide by zero in JavaScript?
```javascript
143143/0 ==>??
```

## Operators
### What will be the output and why?
```javascript
1>2>3 ==>??
3>2>1 ==>??
```
